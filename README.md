# Ahh

**Ahh** is a collection of useful features borrowed from other languages that
have **practical** use-cases in TypeScript. Each module provided by this library
should be **intuitive** to use, **idiomatic** with the rest of the ecosystem,
and not require dependents of your library to also depend on this one.

> **Warning**
>
> Until v1 is released, this should be considered stable-*ish* as most. The
> above principles are still adhered to, but they have not yet been tested
> thoroughly.

Be sure to check out the **[documentation]** and the examples included within
it.
