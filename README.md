# Ahh

**Ahh** is a collection of useful features borrowed from other languages that
have **practical** use-cases in TypeScript. Be sure to check out the
[documentation] and the examples included within it.

## Ethos

**Ahh** has a very simple ethos: be **intuitive** to use, **idiomatic** to
write, and **non-viral** to dependents. Any items you use from these modules
are just as usable if you expose them to dependents; they don't have to depend
on this library as well.

## Licence

All code in the repository is dual-licence under either [MIT] or [Apache 2.0]
licences, at your option. Contributions intentionally submitted by you shall be
dual-licensed, as above, without any additional terms or conditions.
