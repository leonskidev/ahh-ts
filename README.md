# Ahh

**Ahh** is a collection of useful features borrowed from other languages and
made to be idiomatic with the rest of the language. They're also split up into
separate modules so that you can pick an choose what you need.

Each module and its items come with documentation and examples. Some modules
also include a rationale of their design in their documentation, which may be
a fun read for some of you.
